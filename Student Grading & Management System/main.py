# Dictionaries: To hold each studentâ€™s info (name, ID, scores)
# Functions: To add students, calculate GPA, and search records
# Modules: main.py, student_utils.py, reporting.py
# Sets: To prevent duplicate student IDs
# Loop logic: For menu and data entry

# 1. Add New Student
# 2. Enter Scores
# 3. Generate Report Card
# 4. List All Students
# 5. Search by ID
